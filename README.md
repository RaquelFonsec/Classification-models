# Classification-models

The project aims to explore and implement classification models using logistic regression on two datasets: Iris and load_digits. The analysis includes initial dataset exploration, visualization of data distributions, logistic regression modeling, evaluation of model performance metrics, and visualization of confusion matrices.

Installation Instructions:
Clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/RaquelFonsec/Classification-models.git

Navigate to the project directory: 
cd Classification-models

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Initial Analysis:

The Iris dataset contains information on three species of iris with 50 samples for each species.
Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Boxplot and Histogram:

Visualizations using boxplots and histograms characterize the properties of each iris species.
Feature Differentiation:

Based on visualizations, petal length and petal width seem to be sufficient for differentiating between different species.
Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is applied to evaluate the classification model.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to assess the model's performance.
Confusion Matrix:

Confusion matrix is plotted using matplotlib or seaborn to visualize model predictions.
Load Digits Dataset Analysis:
Initial Analysis:

The load_digits dataset contains 1797 samples of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
Logistic Regression:

Logistic regression is applied to classify the digits represented in the images.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.
Confusion Matrix:

Confusion matrix is plotted to visualize model predictions for digits 0-9.
Evaluation for Digits 0-9:

Logistic regression is applied specifically for classifying digits 0-9.
Performance Metrics:

Accuracy, precision, and recall are calculated for the classification of digits 0-9.
Confusion Matrix for Digits 0-9:

Confusion matrix is plotted to visualize model predictions for digits 0-9.
Conclusion:
Based on the analyses performed on both datasets, logistic regression shows promising results in classifying iris species and handwritten digits. The detailed README provides instructions for installing the project and outlines the steps and results of the analyses.
